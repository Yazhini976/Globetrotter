# Globetrotter🌍 About GlobeTrotter

GlobeTrotter is a full-stack web application designed to simplify travel planning by bringing trip organization, itinerary management, and budget tracking into a single platform. The system helps users plan their trips efficiently and manage travel details in a structured and user-friendly way.

In real-world scenarios, travelers often rely on multiple tools such as notes, spreadsheets, or messaging apps to plan trips. GlobeTrotter solves this problem by providing a centralized application where users can create trips, plan activities, and monitor expenses seamlessly.

The application supports user authentication, ensuring that each user can securely access and manage their own travel data. Users can create multiple trips, add itinerary details, and calculate total travel expenses dynamically. The interface is designed with a clean and modern layout to enhance usability and provide a pleasant user experience.

GlobeTrotter is built using Node.js and Express.js for the backend, MySQL for data storage, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The project demonstrates practical implementation of full-stack development concepts and addresses a real-world problem in travel management.
